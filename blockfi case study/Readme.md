# Introduction: Modern banking & Crypto

The banking system is without a doubt, the strongest and most dominant force in the world. The emergence and expansion of modern day banking from the 17th to 19th century was phenomenal, and every year the system grew stronger, behaving as the driving force and the backbone of Nations.

The Modern day & Central banking systems are almost single handedly responsible, or large contributors to a vast majority of the worlds most severe problems over the years. The Banks were funding wars, grossly inflating currencies, single handedly responsible for the GFC, and major players in most financial recessions, the only exception being war (which is funded by banks) or pandemics. To even go as far as pushing a socialist agenda through the world bank / International Monetary Fund (IMF), by flooding weak and corrupt economies with un-payable debt, and building towards a world wide currency, for easy market and economic manipulation & control.

 ## Lets look at some examples:
- Tanzania has received more aid per capita from the IMF then any other nation, whilst under dictatorship by Julius Nyerere, who is notorious for a “villagization” program, in which the army drives peasants out of the land, burns their huts and relocates them to government villages, to control their behaviour and eliminate opposition, hunger is common and the farms are struggling, along with the economy.  Julius was a self proclaimed socialist.

- Mengistu was the president of Ethiopia during the 80s, in which the country was plagued by starvation and hunger, this was in fact planned. Mengistu followed Marxism - Leninism philosophy, which is a communist ideology, developed as an ideology and practice by Joseph Stalin. Mengistu was sent hundreds of millions of dollars from the IMF, right up until he was overthrown.

- The GFC & 2008 housing crisis was a result of Banks and the Fed playing the bailout game. Banks had been getting bailouts from the Federal reserve since inception, as a result banks where signing loans to just about anyone. Making risky loans, packaging them in to large blocks of similar loans, then sell them to unsuspecting investors, under the guise that they would be bailed out if their risky behaviour proved costly. 

The Complete and utter disregard and manipulation of the economy, financial markets, and gross mishandling of fiat currency shows just how badly the banking system works against the every day person. So called “savings accounts” don’t even cover m2 money supply inflations, essentially every $ in savings accounts is slowly becoming worth less every year, and the majority of the population don’t even realise. And so come forth the importance and empowerment of Crypto to the people.
The more one learns about the banking system and global economy, the world bank (IMF), and the national reserves, the more practical and envisioned is a purpose for the crypto currencies, assets, and the technology involved. However for Crypto currencies to overtake central banks and Institutions, and to bring decentralisation on a large scale, would almost certainly have a severe effect on the world and the economy. It would be a result of, or reason for war, and socio- economic upheaval. It would bring in extreme government control and promote communism and a dystopian society. To try and suppress the movement would also have a severe effect on the Governments.
With this in mind, it would be suitable to find a common ground, allowing for banking and institutions to adopt and be a part of the evolving community, and allowing for the community to play a role in modern day banking and finance, without unfair or bias limitations, or restrictions. 

#                                BLOCKFI

## Overview And Origin

BlockFi is a Non bank lender, built around crypto currencies and blockchain technology, founded by Zac Prince (CEO), and Flori Marquez (SVP & Co-Founder) in January 2017. BlockFi has gone through 13 rounds of funding, t
he first being $4 million in 2018. Since then BlockFi has received a total of $508 million dollars funding from over 48 Investors, including some big names in the industry like Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy digital, Coinbase Ventures, and a Partnership with the Winklevoss twins under the Gemini Trust Company.

The idea For BlockFi came to be after Zac Prince was applying for a mortgage, in which trying to declare cryptocurrencies as assets triggered additional compliance checks, as they thought he was doing something illegal.
This Shows a large flaw in the financial system, in which Genuine assets can not be recognised as such by large institutions, viewed as “risky”. For someone who has small income but made a lot of money investing early, or for someone young who wants to build future wealth and has most of their savings in digital assets, if a lender can not recognise these as assets for lending purposes, it forces them to either liquidate some assets for a deposit, or stop investing and focus on saving cash.

BlockFi is A step in the right direction to combatting such problems, helping clients in adopting crypto and digital assets on a retail, and institutional level, in the world of finance and lending. 
The goal is to “ provide credit services to markets with limited access to simple products, like a savings account. Set apart from other crypto asset services, BlockFi Pairs market leading rates with institutional quality benefits.


## Business Model & operations.


The business model used by BlockFi is similar to most finance lenders. The company operates as a “spread” business, essentially borrowing currencies from users that have a a savings account, and lending it out at a higher rate.

Interest rates on savings accounts are as follows:

| Currency | Ammount | APY% |

 BTC(Tier1)/ 0 - 0.25 BTC/ 4%

BTC (Tier2)/ 0.25 - 5 BTC/ 1.5%

BTC (Tier3)/  > 5 BTC / 0.25%


ETH (Tier1)/ 0 - 0.25 ETH/ 4%

ETH (Tier2)/ 0.25 - 5 ETH/ 1.5%

ETH (Tier3)/  > 5 ETH/ 0.25%

                USD STABLECOINS - 
                USDC, GUSD, PAX, USDT, BUSD, DAI.
                  $0 - $50,000 /  7.5%
                     > $50,000 / 5%


BlockFi also offers small interest rates on currencies.
- LTC. LINK. PAXG. UNI. BAT.

Borrowing rates:


| LTV (Loan To Valuation Ratio)
| Interest Rate
| Origination fee

|50%
|9.75%
|2%

|35%
|7.9%
|2%

|20%
|4.5%
|2%




## Why Get a loan at such high rate, with such high collateral?

Even though the initial idea was a light bulb moment when applying for a mortgage, the business model in fact does not work to benefit or be utilised by the every day person.

BlockFi primarily works with institutional counter - parties to offer them easily accessible liquidity to crypto assets. These borrowers consist of:

- ## Traders & Investment funds.
Due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, and its diversity over many countries and realms, there is lots of opportunity for arbitrage trading in a displaced marketplace. They borrow crypto currency to close misplacing gaps between exchanges or dispersed markets. Margin traders will also borrow to capitalise.

- ## Over the Counter (OTC) Market Makers.
Connect buyers and sellers that prefer not to transact over public exchanges, usually at a steep mark-up. These parties need to keep cryptocurrency inventory on hand to meet demand. Owning the Currency is capital intensive and comes at a risk of volatility, OTC market makers will borrow from lenders such as BlockFi to facilitate their needs.

- ## Other Businesses that need crypto currency to provide clients with liquidity.
To ensure safety as the currencies are not government binding, and can not be insured, large asset holdings are kept in cold wallets , and would take time to become liquid. In the time it takes to pull out of cold storage, and opportunity in the market could have closed, which is why BlockFi is useful to investors as a quick source of liquidity.



- Blockfi operates under blockchain technology, which ensures quick transactions world wide, to further benefit traders and investors.





# Risk Management.
## How do we know our Crypto is safe with BlockFi?

BlockFi Is operating with Gemini Trust Company LLC as their primary custodian, Gemini is a licensed custodian and regulated by the NYDFS.
This means that essentially the safety of BlockFi is relied upon by Gemini, which is fully regulated and licensed, and had recently completed an SOC2 Safety audit review by Delloite, crowning them the worlds first Exchange to do so and favourably. The Audit shows that Gemini’s business was built with Security as the main driving point and most important factor.

Gemini keeps 95% of its assets in cold storage, meaning they are safe guarded from hacking, and can only be stolen physically. The other 5% is in a hot wallet, which is more susceptible to being hacked, but still quite safe. 
This being said, Gemini holds BlockFi’s assets.












## What if Loans Default?

BlockFi operates under a strict risk management & credit analysis procedure.
The most important factor being that BlockFi only primarily lends to large, well-capitalised, institutional borrowers, or to counter parties willing to post collateral and provide the ability to margin call on a 24/7 basis. Essentially, BlockFi can only loose money if they can no longer cover the spread between borrowing interest v lending interest, or if their security is compromised.

The collateral process can be explained as such:
If BlockFi are lending $1mill of BTC to Firm X, Firm X will collateralise the loan at around 120% on average, essentially giving $1.2mill to BlockFi.
If the loan where to enter a margin call, and was to default, BlockFi would use their USD collateral to buy Crypto.
BlockFi has been actively lending since 2018, though multiple periods of large volatility, with no losses across. Their entire lending portfolio.




# Industry Landscape, Competitors & Innovations.



## The Banking & Lending Domain.


The Banking system has seen many innovations in the past 10 years, things like open banking, allowing developers to interact with API, machine learning and analysis using cloud data & information. Etc.

The main and most important and influential would be the phase out of Cash, and the use of Phone Banking. Cash is now rarely used, and considered a nuisance. On the other hand people can manage their personal banking accounts, order cards, apply for loans, and send money between banks all on their phone. Although online banking has been around since the late 90’s, it was not until the 21st century that it became very easily usable and sophisticated, to the point where bank branches are closing down and no longer needed.

Although these innovations are effective and beneficial for both parties, they do not provide any changes in the actual banking / lending business model itself, sure lenders can use the innovations to let a computer analyse risk or data, and do so more efficiently,  but the overall business model for lenders & banks has stayed the same.




## Decentralised Finance (DEFI)

The Most recent innovation in the lending industry, and by far the most extraordinary and unique is decentralised finance.
Decentralised finance is an open source project that operates on blockchain technology, and has no “central body” governing it. The project is made by the developers, yes, and is changed and altered by them, but everything else is left to the users. Supply and Demand for a currency is what alters the rates, autonomously, no individual or person can manipulate it.

## Business Model:

Individuals deposit their currencies on the protocol, and earn cumulative interest on their assets, essentially “lending” their assets.
Individuals Borrow currencies at a slightly higher rate than the Depositors are earning on their lends.
Interest Rates are determined By a Currencies Liquidity, which is their utilisation rate comparative to supply and demand. The Less liquidity the currency has, the higher rates are. The more liquidity a currency has, the lower the rates are. The actual percentage rates are determined by an AMM (automated market maker) which is essentially an algorithm that allows a program to automate and change markets based on given information. in this instance it is interest rates relative to liquidity.


Long time Users will earn “governance tokens” in which allow the users to vote on things to be changed or altered on the platform, in which the developers will seek to change.
The DEFI protocols will not allow borrowings of over 80% Loan valuation, meaning that one must post 120% collateral. This is to eradicate negative debt and liquidations on the platform, painting its profitability & usability.

# Competition


Finance Lenders & Banks have the most similar business model, even though banks are starting to offer crypto services to important clients, they are no where near the level of adoption and utilisation as BlockFi. The Difference here is phenomenal, BlockFi offers a better Interest rate on their savings account by more then double the best savings accounts on offer at banks, attracting smaller retail clients to their platform. And Of course, their crypto liquidity is unparalleled to a banks or lenders offerings in the service. Realistically, banks are not much of a competitor.



DEFI Is a lot more probable as a competitor. Defi Follows a similar usage in the crypto space, offering liquidity for investors to use on the blockchain.
The 2 dominant protocols in the space are Compound (COMP) & AAVE.
The problem with DEFI is that due to it being de centralised, it is not well suited for large institutional investors in the space, large amounts of currency in a protocol that has no central authority, with no insurance and no legal bindings to authorities, is very risky, and un-desirable as an investor.
Whilst offering similar services in the crypto space, BlockFi boasts more stability, more retail and institutional services, as well as safety and good customer service. As well as future potential growth. That being said, it would be hard to compare major players in this protocol as competitors.

 ## Celsius network:

 BlockFi's main competitor, celsius network, is the only company that is comparative to Blockfi.

 -  Operates in similar fashion to BlockFi as a spread business, making money on the spread of savings interest spent vs lending interest earned.
 - Celsius network boasts that it gives back 80% of its revenue to users in the form of interest.

 - Celsius network supports 101,000 users world wide, and contains over $730 million in assets.

 - Celsius network supports very large range of crypto assets.

 
 # BlockFi Vs Celsius.

 Both these companies where formed in 2017, with similar visions and business models, both looking to capitalise on the benefits and use of crypto currency adaptation in modern day society, so what divides the 2 from each other, if at all?

 The Main Differences.

 - Celsius boasts better savings rates by an average of 2%.

 - Celsius returns 80%  of Revenue to users, in the form of its native token.

 - Celsius Has less focus on insitutional usage.

 - Celsius is not regulated or Insured.

- Celsius pays interest on many more Crypto assets then BlockFi.


 Overall Celsius seems to have lots of benefits, but without insurance and less institutional backing, the only thing that looks enticing is the % rate difference, but will your assets be safe?

 Just by a glimpse, you can see that BlockFi has major industry dominance

 - Blockfi has Recieved $508 million funding, with over 505 employees, and an estimated $62 million revenue.
  VS
- Celsius has recieved $ 93 million funding, has 156 employees, and an est revenue of $20 million.

BlockFi Has a Business model that is safer and trust worthy for institutional clients. The large ammount of backing and funding from big industry names is enough to gain a bit of trust, but on top of that and their excellent business model, is the fact that their main custodian is Gemini holdings LLC, who is fully regulated and licenced, and holds its assets safely, and also insures a percentage of it.

Due to the nature of the cryptocurrency market and technology, security is very important to investors, to ensure their assets are kept safe. As a large institution who is dealing with  millions of dollars at any given time, security is of the utmost important, Block Fi has a bullet-proof and well designed risk management process, which has prevailed through many periods of market volatility.

BlockFi also has a much better business setting and profile to be able to expand business operations, and much more backing, to speed the process. Soon to bring out a credit card that will pay back rewards in BTC interest, BlockFi are essentialy the closest you will get to seeing a fully regulated crypto bank.


# Moving forward
 
BlockFi has already established a dominance in the lending domain, especially on an institutional level, so where is there room for improvement?

## Retail Market

BlockFi is largely focused on institutional lending, the only thing that retail clients benefit from this product is the high interest savings accounts.

Lending for Retail Clients is extremely un-favourable. To get a loan worth just 50% of your collateral you are paying a 9.75% Annual interest rate. Posting 150% collateral to get a loan at such a high rate is more or less pointless, especially for a large sum of money.
Decentralised finance would be better suited for a retail loan as you can loan up to 80% of your collateral, at variable rates, ranging from 3-5%, on average. But you earn about 1-2% less on your collateral deposit, essentialy bringing your rate down 1-2%. Making for a cheap loan, with no maximum or minimum ammounts.

## improvements 

How could Blockfi utilise its position and business to become more beneficial for retail clients?.

- Incorporate an independant credit report analysis that Will allow Clients access to Personal loans, business loans, and mortgage loans without having to post over 100% collateral.

 To implement this would be tricky to navigate, as to how to maintain a spread profit on interest paid and interest earned. They would need to implimiment a credit reporting system that evaluates each individuals financial situation and serviceability of the loan. Interest rates would have to be higher then that of a usual bank Mortgage, and be fixed over a fixed term to ensure that BlockFi can turn over a profit on the loan. 

To make the process more profitable and ensure no human error or negative influence, BlockFi could use an AMM ( automated market maker) algorithm and risk analysis program to put together the given information on a loan proposal to provide the client with a final calculation on % interest in regards to serviceability and LTV ratio.

Due to these loans being under 100% collateralised, the borrower could have to take money out of their savings account and post it as "bond" or "deposit", to collaterlise loan, independantly from their savings account on the platform.

 Offering these services, would see more people leaving the traditional banking system and moving into the crypto economy. One of the biggest raod blocks of large scale adoption is that fact that one can not post their crypto assets as collateral for common loans, such as a mortgage, within a reasonable LTV and interest rate. Younger generations who believe in the space and want to move out of the fractional banking system are presented with this roadblock, if BlockFi could navigate a model to help retail clients in this area and still be profitable and safe, they would be able to encapsulate a larger market for their products and services.

 # Conclusion


BlockFi is a revolutionary step in the right direction to providing beneficial, large scale adaptation world wide to cryptocurrency exposure, on a retail and institutional scale.

They operate under a sound and full proof "spread" business model, that provides large efficiency and usability with no direct risk exposure, as well as operating under a fully licenced custodian whom of which also has a very safe procedure for holding assets, shows that BlockFi is a sound business and has a large focus on clientele safety and security. This is proven by their 0% losses recorded through volatile times. You could be assured your assets are safe with BlockFi.


Looking past their business models and metrics, BlockFi has a large market cominance, with a business size over 5x that of its main competitor, celcisus. With this dominance, BlockFi has major potential moving forward, to bring new products and help retail clients get in to the crypto space and benefit from it, and their services.
 

 BlockFi is on its way to become the first Crypto Bank, and it is hard to envision another company catching up.
